# Overview

Janvi Dreamer is a personal portfolio website for a gaming content creator and YouTuber from Madhya Pradesh, India. The site serves as a professional showcase featuring an interactive homepage with personal information, social media links, and a Discord verification portal. Built with React and modern web technologies using route-based code splitting for optimal multi-page performance, it emphasizes visual appeal with animations, dark/light theme support, and responsive design.

## November 4, 2025 - Cursor Styling Improvements
- Comprehensive cursor styling audit and fixes across all interactive elements
- Added `cursor-pointer` class to all custom buttons, links, and clickable divs throughout `client/src/pages` and `client/src/components`
- Removed incorrect `cursor-pointer` from non-interactive hero avatar image
- Fixed files: verification-portal.tsx, verify-now.tsx, welcome.tsx, hero-section.tsx, social-section.tsx, user-profile.tsx, verify.tsx, verification-footer.tsx
- Note: Shadcn/ui Button components have correct cursor styling by default and don't require explicit cursor-pointer class

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# Package Management Rules

**Important**: Always use `pnpm` for package management instead of `npm`. This includes:
- Installing packages: `pnpm install <package-name>`
- Installing dev dependencies: `pnpm install -D <package-name>`
- Running scripts: `pnpm run <script-name>`
- Installing all dependencies: `pnpm install`

Never use `npm install` or `npm` commands for this project.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Routing**: Multi-page application with separate HTML entry points for each route
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds with manual chunk splitting
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and caching with React hooks for local state
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based lazy loading ensures each page loads independently with its own chunk
- **Documentation System**: `/guide` page with markdown rendering, multi-language support, and theme switching

## UI and Styling
- **Design System**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and CSS variables
- **Theming**: Dark/light mode support with CSS custom properties
- **Typography**: Google Fonts (Inter, Playfair Display, JetBrains Mono)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for component animations, AOS for scroll animations, GSAP for interactive effects

## Data Management
- **Default Data System**: Centralized `/lib/default-data.ts` with modular exports for instant content display
- **Data Source**: Hybrid approach using instant default data with background API replacement
- **Loading Strategy**: Instant fallback display → background API loading → smooth data replacement
- **Caching**: 5-minute cache duration with automatic fallback to static data
- **Types**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- **Service Layer**: Centralized data service with error handling and cache management

## Component Structure
- **Layout**: Modular section-based components (Hero, About, Social, Footer)
- **UI Components**: Reusable Shadcn/ui components with consistent styling
- **Reusable Verification Component**: `VerifyComponent` for YouTube verification flow that accepts user data and callback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with optimized touch interactions
- **Instant Loading**: Default data displays immediately with smooth transitions when API data loads

## Verification System
- **Token Generation**: Backend API integration at `https://janvi.jarvibeta.xyz/api/generate-token`
- **Cookie Management**: 10-minute token caching in browser cookies to prevent duplicate API calls
- **Authentication Check**: Login status verification using localStorage-based auth system
- **Verification Flow**: `/verify/now` page handles login check, token generation, and verification state
- **Smart Redirects**: Automatic redirects for non-logged users and already-verified users

## Performance Optimizations
- **Route-Based Code Splitting**: React.lazy() with Suspense for independent page loading
- **Manual Chunk Splitting**: Vendor libraries (290kB), route-specific chunks (homepage 16kB, portal 16kB, not-found 3kB)
- **Lazy Loading**: Each route loads only its required code and data on-demand
- **Image Optimization**: WebP support with fallbacks
- **Animation Performance**: Reduced motion support and mobile-optimized animations
- **Caching Strategy**: Service worker ready with static asset caching
- **Zero Loading Time**: Instant content display using centralized default data system
