# <span style="color:red;">Data Deletion</span>

## Important Information

If you only logged into our site through Discord, we don't keep any of your information in our database.
When you log in with the Discord bot, we only get your Discord information once. After that, we never look at it again.
The data that was retrieved is only saved locally in your browser's localStorage for the session.
If this is the case, you can be sure that no personal information is left on our servers. Just **<span style="color:red;">log out</span>**.

When you're done verification with Google OAuth, you can use the steps below to delete any information related to verification.
